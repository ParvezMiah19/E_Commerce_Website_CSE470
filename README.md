# E_Commerce_Website_CSE470
This is my project built for the CSE 470: Software Engineering course at Brac University. This course requires building a project following the MVC architecture. Also, the students need to follow the Agile methodology practices and complete the project in 5 sprints. The first two sprints are based on project selection, feasibility analysis, and requirement engineering. The third and fourth sprint is focused on applying the MVC pattern, running the project, and using a git repository. Lastly, the fifth sprint is about unit testing the project.
